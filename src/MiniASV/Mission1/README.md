## What is going on?

We will use mostly DUNE libraries.

### #1 Step
Make Goto on pool coordinates. Depends on localization values.
Will use latitude as **x** and longitude as **y**

Set initial values in the beginning (somehow) and the final values will go by KeyboardInputs by Bernardo
Awesome to test, later will add more features.
